 *  @author ClÃ©ment Lesaege - <clement@lesaege.com>
 *  
 *  This contract implements the RNG standard and gives parties incentives to save the blockhash to avoid it to become unreachable after 256 blocks.
 *  In case no one called it within the 256 blocks, it returns the previous blockhash.
 *  This contract must be used when returning 0 is a worse failure mode than returning another blockhash.
 *  Note that if someone calls it within the timeframe, this contracts acts exactly as BlockHashRNG.
